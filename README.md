# final-project
This program starts with a personality quiz. At the end of the quiz, you will get a summary of your personality type, an artist with a similar personality, their top tracks, and it will play the top song out loud. To take the quiz: run the program and hit "enter" to advance through questions. Needed to run: mp3 files: taylorswift.mp3, bobdylan.mp3, queen.mp3, and alanjackson.mp3. (These mp3s need to be in the same place as the finalproject.py to run) & pygame installed
