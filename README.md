# final-project
This program starts with a personality quiz. The answers from this will determine which Spotify artist gets presented to you. At the end of the quiz, you will get your personality type, an artist with a similar personality, their top tracks, and play the top song out loud. 
The clientid.txt file is the file that holds the client ID and client secret, needed to run spotipy. 
Instructions on importing: idk still trying to figure that out
The quiz and results portion of the code works perfectly, Im having issues with Spotipy download & errors when it runs.
